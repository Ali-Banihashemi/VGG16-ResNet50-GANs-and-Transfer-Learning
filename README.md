# Deep Learning Projects: VGG16, ResNet50, GANs, and Transfer Learning

This repository contains several projects that demonstrate advanced techniques in deep learning, including image classification with VGG16 and ResNet50, data augmentation, GANs, and transfer learning. The work presented here showcases my skills and understanding of these important areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

This was done for the AI course in 2024 at the University of Tehran under the instruction of Professor Khoshnevisan.

## Overview

### Part I: Image Classification with VGG16 and ResNet50
- **A. Classification of Skin Diseases**: Using VGG16 and ResNet50 to classify three different skin diseases (Nevus, Melanoma, and Carcinoma) with and without data augmentation. The classification reports for all four models are compared.
- **B. Architecture Explanation**: Explanation of the architectures of VGG16 and ResNet50.
- **C. Code Explanation**: Detailed explanation of the codes for VGG16 and ResNet50 with data augmentation.
- **D. Data Augmentation**: Discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of data augmentation in Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Part II: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- **A. DCGAN for CIFAR-10**: Creation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The codes are explained in detail.
- **B. Optimizing the Generator's Objective Function**: Comparison of Gradient Ascent and Gradient Descent for optimizing the generator's objective function in GANs, with an example demonstrating the superiority of Gradient Ascent.

### Part III: Transfer Learning
- **A. Transfer Learning for Small, Dissimilar Datasets**: How to employ transfer learning when the dataset is small and very different from the original dataset used to train the pre-trained model, with an example using Python and TensorFlow.
- **B. Transfer Learning for Small, Similar Datasets**: How to employ transfer learning when the dataset is small and similar to the original dataset used to train the pre-trained model, with an example using Python and TensorFlow.

## Key Takeaways
- **Image Classification**: Learn how to implement and compare VGG16 and ResNet50 models with and without data augmentation.
- **GANs**: Understand the creation and optimization of DCGANs.
- **Transfer Learning**: See practical examples of transfer learning for different types of datasets.
